This is a final project for the Solana Bootcamp - Part 2 of the Project.

Solana Programs perform checks on instructions to ensure security and that required invariants are not being violated.

These checks depend on the actual task of the Solana Program.

In this mini project, we can observe some of the common checks a Solana Program can perform: 
1. Check the program ID from the instruction is the program ID of your program
2. Check that the order and number of accounts are correct
3. Check the initialization state of an account
